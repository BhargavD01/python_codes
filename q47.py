#Given two sets, demonstrate union, intersection, and difference.
# Define two sets
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Union
union_set = set_a | set_b

# Intersection
intersection_set = set_a & set_b

# Difference
difference_set = set_a - set_b

# Print the results
print("Union:", union_set)
print("Intersection:", intersection_set)
print("Difference (A - B):", difference_set)
